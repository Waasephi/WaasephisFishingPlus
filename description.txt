Waasephi's Fishing Plus is a simple content mod focused on making fishing in terraria easier to interact with, and less of a grind.

This mod contains: 

- Many different fish in unique areas to encourage fishing more

- Super rare "legendary fish" if you want a "challenge"

- New fishing quests in new areas for more variety

- New crates with later game items, as well as tweaks to existing crate loot tables (only additions!)

- Passive critters in most biomes to add life to the world

- New quality of life tools, including Fishing Rods, Angler quest rerolling, and more

- A couple new armor sets and equipment, all related to fishing buffs

- Clams and their furniture

- Custom fish filleting system, which turns fish into useful items, and mitigates some of Terraria's grinds


I am not a professional coder by any means, so there are likely bugs and oversights.
Informing me of such issues is the easiest way to get me to fix them.

Thank you to these people who have helped me with this mod.
